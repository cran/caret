\section{Changes in version 6.0-29}{
\itemize{
\item  A man page with the list of models available via \code{trian} was added back into the package. See \code{?models}.

\item  Thoralf Mildenberger found and fixed a bug in the variable importance
calculation for neural network models. 

\item The output of \code{varImp} for \code{pamr} models was updated to clarify the ordering of the importance scores.

\item \code{getModelInfo} was updated to generate a more informative error message if the user looks for a model that is not in the package's model library. 

\item A bug was fixed related to how seeds were set inside of \code{train}. 

\item The model \code{"parRF"} (parallel random forest) was added back into the library.  

\item When case weights are specified in \code{train}, the hold-out weights are exposed when computing the summary function. 

\item A check was made to convert a \code{data.table} given to \code{train} to a data frame (see \url{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23256177/r-caret-renames-column-in-data-table-after-training}).

}
}

\section{Changes in version 6.0-25}{
\itemize{
\item Changes were made that stoped execution of \code{train} if there are no rows in the data (changes suggested by Andrew Ziem)

\item Andrew Ziem also helped improve the documentation.
}
}

\section{Changes in version 6.0-24}{
\itemize{
\item Several models were updated to work with case weights.

\item A bug in \code{rfe} was found where the largest subset size have the same results as the full model. Thanks to Jose Seoane for reporting the bug. 
}
}

\section{Changes in version 6.0-22}{
\itemize{
\item For some parallel processing technologies, the package now export 
more internal functions. 
 
\item A bug was fixed in \code{rfe} that occurred when LOO CV was used.

\item Another bug was fixed that occurred for some models when 
\code{tuneGrid} contained only a single model.
 }
}


\section{Changes in version 6.0-21}{
\itemize{
\item A new system for user-defined models has been added. See 
\href{http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/custom_models.html}{http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/custom_models.html}.

\item When creating the grid of tuning parameter values, the column 
names no longer need to be preceded by a period. Periods can still be 
used as before but are not required. This isn't guaranteed to break
backwards compatibility but it may in some cases. 

\item \code{trainControl} now has a \code{method = "none"} resampling
option that bypasses model tuning and fits the model to the entire
training set. Note that if more than one model is specified an error
will occur.

 \item \code{logicForest} models were removed since the package is
 now archived.

 \item \code{CSimca} and \code{RSimca} models from the \cpkg{rrcovHD} 
 package were added.

 \item  Model \code{elm} from the \cpkg{elmNN} 
 package was added.

  \item  Models \code{rknn} and \code{rknnBel} from the \cpkg{rknn} 
 package were added

  \item  Model \code{brnn} from the \cpkg{brnn} 
 package was added.

 \item \code{panel.lift2} and \code{xyplot.lift} now have an argument 
 called \code{values} that show the percentages of samples found for
 the specified percentages of samples tested. 

\item \code{train}, \code{rfe} and \code{sbf} should no longer throw 
a warning that "executing %dopar% sequentially: no parallel backend registered".

\item A \code{ggplot} method for \code{train} was added.

\item Imputation via medians was added to \code{preProcess} by Zachary Mayer.

\item A small change was made to \code{rpart} models. Previously, when the 
final model is determined, it would be fit by specifying the model using the 
\code{cp} argument of \code{rpart.control}. This could lead to duplicated Cp 
values in the final list of possible Cp values. The current version fits the 
final model slightly different. An initial model is fit using \code{cp = 0} 
then it is pruned using \code{prune.rpart} to the desired depth. This 
shouldn't be different for the vast majority of data sets. Thanks to Jeff
Evans for pointing this out.

\item The method for estimating sigma for SVM and RVM models was slightly 
changed to make them consistent with how \code{ksvm} and \code{rvm} does the 
estimation.

\item The default behavior for \code{returnResamp} in \code{rfeControl} and
 \code{sbfControl} is now \code{returnResamp = "final"}. 

\item \code{cluster} was added as a general class with a specific method
for \code{resamples} objects.

\item The refactoring of model code resulted in a number of packages being
eliminated from the depends field. Additionally, a few were moved to exports.

}
}

\section{Changes in version 5.17-07}{
\itemize{
 \item A bug in \code{spatialSign} was fixed for data frames with 
 a single column.

 \item Pre-processing was not applied to the training data set 
 prior to grid creation. This is now done but only for models
 that use the data when defining the grid. Thanks to Brad Buchsbaum
 for finding the bug.

 \item Some code was added to \code{rfe} to truncate the subset
 sizes in case the user over-specified them.

 \item A bug was fixed in \code{gamFuncs} for the \code{rfe} 
 function.  
 
 \item Option in \code{trainControl}, \code{rfeControl} and 
 \code{sbfControl} were added so that the user can set the 
 seed at each resampling iteration (most useful for parallel 
 processing). Thanks to Allan Engelhardt for the recommendation. 

 \item Some internal refactoring of the data was done to prepare
 for some upcoming resampling options.
 
 \item \code{predict.train} now has an explicit \code{na.action} 
 argument defaulted to \code{na.omit}. If imputation is used in 
 \code{train}, then \code{na.action = na.pass} is recommended. 
 
 \item A bug was fixed in \code{dummyVars} that occured when 
 missing data were in \code{newdata}. The function 
 \code{contr.dummy} is now deprecated and \code{contr.ltfr} 
 should be used (if you are using it at all). Thanks to 
 stackexchange user mchangun for finding the bug.
 
 \item A check is now done inside \code{dummyVars} when 
 \code{levelsOnly = TRUE} to see if any predictors share common 
 levels. 
 
 \item A new option \code{fullRank} was added to \code{dummyVars}. 
 When true, \code{contr.treatment} is used. Otherwise,  
 \code{contr.ltfr} is used.

 \item A bug in \code{train} was fixed with \code{gbm} models 
 (thanks to stackoverflow user screechOwl for finding it).
 
 }
 }


\section{Changes in version 5.16-24}{
\itemize{
 \item The \code{protoclass} function in the \cpkg{protoclass} 
 package was added. The model uses a distance matrix as input and 
 the \code{train} method also uses the \cpkg{proxy} package to 
 compute the distance using the Minkowski distance. The two tuning 
 parameters is the neighborhood size (\code{eps}) and the Minkowski 
 distance parameter (\code{p}).

 \item A bug was (hopefully) fixed that occurred when some type of 
 parallel processing was used with \code{train}. The problem is 
 that the \cpkg{methods} package was not being loaded in the workers. 
 While reproducible, it is unknown why this occurs and why it is 
 only for some technologies and systems. The \cpkg{methods} package 
 is now a formal dependency and we coerce the workers to load it 
 remotely. 
 
 \item A bug was fixed where some calls were printed twice. 

 \item For \code{rpart}, \code{C5.0} and \code{ksvm}, cost-sensitive 
 versions of these models for two classes were added to \code{train}. 
 The method values are \code{rpartCost}, \code{C5.0Cost} and 
 \code{svmRadialWeights}.

 \item The prediction code for the \code{ksvm} models was changed. There 
are some cases where the class predictions and the predicted class 
probabilities disagree. This usually happens when the probabilities are 
close to 0.50 (in the two class case). A \cpkg{kernlab} bug has been 
filed. In the meantime, if the \code{ksvm} model uses a probability 
model, the class probabilities are generated first and the predicted 
class is assigned to the probability with the largest value. Thanks to
Kjell Johnson for finding that one. 

\item \code{print.train} was changed so that tune parameters that are
logicals are printed well.  
 
 }
 }


\section{Changes in version 5.16-13}{
\itemize{
 \item Added a few exemptions to the logic that determines whether a model call should be scrubbed.
 
 \item An error trap was created to catch issues with missing importance scores in \code{rfe}.
 
 }
 }

\section{Changes in version 5.16-03}{
\itemize{
 \item A function \code{twoClassSim} was added for benchmarking classification models. 

 \item A bug was fixed in \code{predict.nullModel} related to predicted class probabilities. 
 
 \item The version requirement for \cpkg{gbm} was updated.
 
 \item The function \code{getTrainPerf} was made visible.
 
 \item The automatic tuning grid for \code{sda} models from the \cpkg{sda} package was changed to include \code{lambda}.
 
 \item When \code{randomForests} is used with \code{train} and \code{tuneLength == 1}, the \code{randomForests} default value for \code{mtry} is used.
 
 \item Maximum uncertainty linear discriminant analysis (\code{Mlda}) and factor-based linear discriminant analysis (\code{RFlda}) from the \cpkg{HiDimDA} package were added to \code{train}.
} 
}

\section{Changes in version 5.15-87}{
\itemize{

\item Added the Yeo-Johnson power transformation from the \cpkg{car}
package to the \code{preProcess} function.

\item A \code{train} bug was fixed for the \code{rrlda} model (found
by Tiago Branquinho Oliveira).

\item The \code{extraTrees} model in the \cpkg{extraTrees} package was
added.

\item The \code{kknn.train} model in the \cpkg{kknn} package was
added.

\item A bug was fixed in \code{lrFuncs} where the class threshold was
improperly set (thanks to David Meyer).

\item A bug related to newer versions of the \cpkg{gbm} package were fixed. 
Another \cpkg{gbm} bug was fixed related to using non-Bernoulli distributions 
with two class outcomes (thanks to Zachary Mayer).

\item The old funciton \code{getTrainPerf} was finally made visible. 

\item Some models are created using "do.call" and may contain the
entire data set in the call object. A function to "scrub" some model call
objects was added to reduce their size. 

\item The tuning process for \code{sda:::sda} models was changed to
add the \code{lambda} parameter.

}
}

\section{Changes in version 5.15-60}{
\itemize{ 

\item A bug in \code{predictors.earth}, discovered by Katrina Bennett,
was fixed.

\item A bug induced by version 5.15-052 for the bootstrap 632 rule was
fixed.

\item The DESCRIPTION file as of 5.15-048 should have used a
version-specific lattice dependency.

\item \code{lift} can compute gain and lift charts (and defaults to
gain)

\item The \cpkg{gbm} model was updated to handle 3 or more classes. 

\item For bagged trees using \cpkg{ipred}, the code in \code{train}
defaults to \code{keepX = FALSE} to save space. Pass in \code{keepX =
TRUE} to use out-of-bag sampling for this model.

\item Changes were made to support vector machines for classification
models due to bugs with class probabilities in the latest version of
\cpkg{kernlab}. The \code{prob.model} will default to the value of
\code{classProbs} in the \code{trControl} function. If
\code{prob.model} is passed in as an argument to \code{train}, this
specification over-rides the default. In other words, to avoid
generating a probability model, set either \code{classProbs = FALSE}
or \code{prob.model = FALSE}. 

}
}

\section{Changes in version 5.15-052}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{bayesglm} from the \cpkg{arm} package. 

\item A few bugs were fixed in \code{bag}, thanks to Keith
Woolner. Most notably, out-of-bag estimates are now computed when the
prediction function includes a column called \code{pred}.

\item Parallel processing was implemented in \code{bag} and
\code{avNNet}, which can be turned off using an optional arguments.

\item \code{train}, \code{rfe}, \code{sbf}, \code{bag} and
\code{avNNet} were given an additional argument in their respective
control files called \code{allowParallel} that defaults to
\code{TRUE}. When \code{Code}, the code will be executed in parallel
if a parallel backend (e.g. \cpkg{doMC}) is registered. When
\code{allowParallel = FALSE}, the parallel backend is always
ignored. The use case is when \code{rfe} or \code{sbf} calls
\code{train}. If a parallel backend with P processors is being used,
the combination of these functions will create P^2 processes. Since
some operations benefit more from parallelization than others, the
user has the ability to concentrate computing resources for specific
functions.

\item A new resampling function called \code{createTimeSlices} was
contributed by Tony Cooper that generates cross-validation indices for
time series data.

\item A few more options were added to
\code{trainControl}. \code{initialWindow}, \code{horizon} and
\code{fixedWindow} are applicable for when \code{method =
"timeslice"}. Another, \code{indexOut} is an optional list of
resampling indices for the hold-out set. By default, these values are
the unique set of data points not in the training set.

\item A bug was fixed in multiclass \code{glmnet} models when
generating class probabilities (thanks to Bradley Buchsbaum for
finding it).
}
}


\section{Changes in version  5.15-048}{
\itemize{ 

\item The three vignettes were removed and two things were added: a
smaller vignette and a large collection of help pages at
\url{http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/}.

\item Minkoo Seo found a bug where \code{na.action} was not being properly
set with train.formula().

\item \code{parallel.resamples} was changed to properly account for
missing values.

\item Some testing code was removed from \code{probFunction} and 
\code{predictionFunction}. 

\item Fixed a bug in \code{sbf} exposed by a new version of \cpkg{plyr}.

\item Changed the package dependency on \cpkg{reshape} to \cpkg{reshape2}. 

\item To be more consistent with recent versions of \cpkg{lattice},
the \code{parallel.resamples} function was changed to
\code{parallelplot.resamples}.

\item Since \code{ksvm} now allows probabilities when class weights
are used, the default behavior in \code{train} is to set
\code{prob.model = TRUE} unless the user explicitly sets it to
\code{FALSE}. However, I have reported a bug in \code{ksvm} that gives
inconsistent results with class weights, so this is not advised at
this point in time.

\item Bugs were fix in \code{predict.bagEarth} and
\code{predict.bagFDA}.

\item When using \code{rfeControl(saveDetails = TRUE)} or
\code{sbfControl(saveDetails = TRUE)} an additional column is
added to \code{object$pred} called \code{rowIndex}. This indicates the
row from the original data that is being held-out.

}
}

\section{Changes in version  5.15-045}{
\itemize{ 

\item A bug was fixed that induced \code{NA} values in SVM model predictions. 
}
}

\section{Changes in version  5.15-042}{
\itemize{ 

\item Many examples are wrapped in dontrun to speed up cran checking.

\item The \code{scrda} methods were removed from the package (on
6/30/12, R Core sent an email that "since we haven't got fixes for
long standing warnings of the rda packages since more than half a year
now, we set the package to ORPHANED.")

\item \cpkg{C5.0} was added (model codes \code{C5.0}, \code{C5.0Tree} and
\code{C5.0Rules}).

\item Fixed a bug in \code{train} with NaiveBayes when \code{fL != 0}
was used

\item The output of \code{train} with \code{verboseIter = TRUE} was
modified to show the resample label as well as logging when the worker
started and stopped the task (better when using parallel processing).

\item Added a long-hidden function \code{downSample} for class imbalances

\item An \code{upSample} function was added for class imbalances. 

\item A new file, aaa.R, was added to be compiled first that tries to
eliminate the dreaded 'no visible binding for global variable' false
positives. Specific namespaces were used with several functions for
avoid similar warnings.

\item A bug was fixed with \code{icr.formula} that was so ridiculous,
I now know that nobody has ever used that function.

\item Fixed a bug when using \code{method = "oob"} with \code{train}

\item Some exceptions were added to \code{plot.train} so that some
tuning parameters are better labeled.

\item \code{dotplot.resamples} and \code{bwplot.resamples} now order
the models using the first metric.

\item A few of the lattice plots for the \code{resamples} class were
changed such that when only one metric is shown: the strip is not
shown and the x-axis label displays the metric

\item When using \code{trainControl(savePredictions = TRUE)} an
additional column is added to \code{object$pred} called
\code{rowIndex}. This indicates the row from the original data that is
being held-out.

\item A variable importance function for \code{nnet} objects was
created based on Gevrey, M., Dimopoulos, I., & Lek, S. (2003). Review
and comparison of methods to study the contribution of variables in
artificial neural network models. ecological modelling, 160(3),
249–264.

\item The \code{predictor} function for \code{glmnet} was update and a
variable importance function was also added.

\item Raghu Nidagal found a bug in \code{predict.avNNet} that was
fixed.

\item \code{sensitivity} and \code{specificity} were given an
\code{na.rm} argument.

\item A first attempt at fault tolerance was added to \code{train}. If
a model fit fails, the predictions are set to \code{NA} and a warning
is issued (eg "model fit failed for Fold04: sigma=0.00392,
C=0.25"). When \code{verboseIter = TRUE}, the warning is also printed
to the log. Resampled performance is calculated on only the
non-missing estimates. This can also be done during predictions, but
must be done on a model by model basis. Fault tolerance was added for
\cpkg{kernlab} models only at this time.

\item \code{lift} was modified in two ways. First, \code{cuts} is no
longer an argument. The function always uses cuts based on the number
of unique probability estimates. Second, a new argument called
\code{label} is available to use alternate names for the models
(e.g. names that are not valid R variable names). 

\item A bug in \code{print.bag} was fixed. 

\item Class probabilities were not being generated for sparseLDA
models.

\item Bugs were fixed in the new varImp methods for PART and RIPPER

\item Starting using namespaces for \code{ctree} and \code{cforest} to
avoid conflicts between duplicate function names in the \cpkg{party}
and \cpkg{partykit} package

\item A set of functions for RFE and logistic regression
(\code{lrFuncs}) was added.

\item A bug in \code{train} with \code{method="glmStepAIC"} was fixed
so that \code{direction} and other \code{stepAIC} arguments were
honored.

\item A bug was fixed in \code{preProcess} where the number of ICA
components was not specified. (thanks to Alexander Lebedev)

\item Another bug was fixed for oblique random forest methods in
\code{train}. (thanks to Alexander Lebedev)

}
}

\section{Changes in version  5.15-023}{
\itemize{ 

\item The list of models that can accept factor inputs directly was
expanded to include the \cpkg{RWeka} models, \code{ctree},
\code{cforest} and custom models.

\item Added model \code{lda2}, which tunes by the number of functions
used during prediction.

\item \code{predict.train} allows probability predictions for custom
models now (thanks to Peng Zhang)

\item \code{confusionMatrix.train} was updated to use the default
\code{confusionMatrix} code when \code{norm = "none"} and only a
single hold-out was used.

\item Added  variable importance  metrics for PART  and RIPPER  in the
\cpkg{RWeka} package.

\item vignettes were moved from /inst/doc to /vignettes

}
}


\section{Changes in version  5.14-023}{
\itemize{ 

\item The model details in \code{?train} was changed to be more
readable

\item Added two models from the \cpkg{RRF} package. \code{RRF} uses a
penalty for each predictor based on the scaled variable importance
scores from a prior random forest fit. \code{RRFglobal} sets a common,
global penalty across all predictors.

\item Added two models from the \cpkg{KRLS} package: \code{krlsRadial}
and \code{krlsPoly}. Both have kernel parameters (\code{sigma} and
\code{degree}) and a common regularization parameter
\code{lambda}. The default for \code{lambda} is \code{NA}, letting the
\code{krls} function estimate it internally. \code{lambda} can also be
specified via \code{tuneGrid}.

\item \code{twoClassSummary} was modified to wrap the call to
\code{pROC:::roc} in a \code{try} command. In cases where the hold-out
data are only from one class, this produced an error. Now it generates
\code{NA} values for the AUC when this occurs and a general warning is
issued.

\item The underlying workflows for \code{train} were modified so that
missing values for performance measures would not throw an error (but
will issue a warning).

}
}


\section{Changes in version  5.13-037}{
\itemize{ 

\item Models \code{mlp}, \code{mlpWeightDecay}, \code{rbf} and
\code{rbfDDA} were added from \cpkg{RSNNS}.

\item Functions \code{roc}, \code{rocPoint} and \code{aucRoc} finally
met their end. The cake was a lie.

\item This NEWS file was converted over to Rd format.
}
}


\section{Changes in version 5.13-020}{
\itemize{ 

\item \code{\link{lift}} was expanded into \code{\link{lift.formula}}
   for calculating the plot points and \code{\link{xyplot.lift}} to
   create the plot.

\item The package vignettes were altered to stop loading external
   RData files.

\item A few \code{match.call} changes were made to pass new R CMD
check tests.

\item \code{\link{calibration}}, \code{\link{calibration.formula}} and
   \code{\link{xyplot.calibration}} were created to make probability
   calibration plots.

\item Model types \code{xyf} and \code{bdk} from the \cpkg{kohonen}
package were added.

\item \code{\link{update.train}} was added so that tuning parameters
   can be manually set if the automated approach to setting their
   values is insufficient.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.11-006}{
\itemize{ 

\item When using \code{method = "pls"} in \code{\link{train}}, the
   \code{\link[pls]{plsr}} function used the default PLS algorithm
   ("kernelpls"). Now, the full orthogonal scores method is used. This
   results in the same model, but a more extensive set of values are
   calculated that enable VIP calculations (without much of a loss in
   computational efficient).

\item A check was added to \code{\link{preProcess}} to ensure valid
   values of \code{method} were used.

\item  A new method, \code{kernelpls}, was added.

\item \code{residuals} and \code{summary} methods were added to
   \code{\link{train}} objects that pass the final model to their
   respective functions.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.11-006}{
\itemize{ 

\item  Bugs were fixed that prevented hold-out predictions from being
   returned.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.11-003}{
\itemize{ 

\item A bug in \code{roc} was found when the classes were completely
   separable.

\item The ROC calculations for \code{\link{twoClassSummary}} and
   \code{\link{filterVarImp}} were changed to use the \cpkg{pROC}
   package. This, and other changes, have increased efficiency. For
   \code{\link{filterVarImp}} on the cell segmentation data lead to a
   54-fold decrease in execution time. For the Glass data in the
   \cpkg{mlbench} package, the speedup was 37-fold. Warnings were
   added for \code{roc}, \code{aucRoc} and
   \code{rocPoint} regarding their deprecation.

\item random ferns (package \cpkg{rFerns}) were added

\item Another sparse LDA model (from the penalizedLDA) was also added

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.09-002}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed a bug which occurred when \code{\link[pls]{plsda}} models were used with class
   probabilities

\item As of 8/15/11, the \code{\link[glmnet]{glmnet}} function was
   updated to return a character vector. Because of this,
   \code{\link{train}} required modification and a version requirement
   was put in the package description file.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.09-006}{
\itemize{ 

\item Shea X made a suggestion and provided code to improve the speed
   of prediction when sequential parameters are used for
   \code{\link[gbm]{gbm}} models.

\item Andrew Ziem suggested an error check with \code{metric = "ROC"} and
   \code{classProbs = FALSE}.

\item Andrew Ziem found a bug in how \code{\link{train}} obtained
   \code{\link[earth]{earth}} class probabilities

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.08-011}{
\itemize{ 

\item Andrew Ziem found another small bug with parallel processing and
   \code{\link{train}} (functions in the caret namespace cannot be found).

\item Ben Hoffman found a bug in \code{\link{pickSizeTolerance}} that was fixed.

\item Jiaye Yu found (and fixed) a bug in getting predictions back from
   \code{\link{rfe}}

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.07-024}{
\itemize{ 

\item Using \code{saveDetails = TRUE} in \code{\link{sbfControl}} or
   \code{\link{rfeControl}} will save the predictions on the hold-out
   sets (Jiaye Yu wins the prize for finding that one).

\item \code{\link{trainControl}} now has a logical to save the hold-out predictions.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.07-005}{
\itemize{ 

\item \code{type = "prob"} was added for \code{\link{avNNet}} prediction.

\item A warning was added when a model from \cpkg{RWeka} is used with
   \code{\link{train}} and (it appears that) \cpkg{multicore} is being
   used for parallel processing. The session will crash, so don't do
   that.

\item A bug was fixed where the extrapolation limits were being
   applied in \code{\link{predict.train}} but not in
   \code{\link{extractPrediction}}. Thanks to Antoine Stevens for
   finding this.

\item Modifications were made to some of the workflow code to expose
   internal functions. When parallel processing was used with
   \cpkg{doMPI} or \cpkg{doSMP}, \cpkg{foreach} did not find some
   \cpkg{caret} internals (but \cpkg{doMC} did).


 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.07-001}{
\itemize{ 

\item changed calls to \code{\link[pls]{predict.mvr}} since the \cpkg{pls} package now has a
   namespace.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.06-002}{
\itemize{ 

\item a beta version of custom models with \code{\link{train}} is included. The
   "caretTrain" vignette was updated with a new section that defines
   how to make custom models.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.05-004}{
\itemize{ 

\item laying some of the groundwork for custom models
 
\item updates to get away from deprecated (mean and sd on data frames)

\item The pre-processing in \code{\link{train}} bug of the last
   version was not entirely squashed. Now it is.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.04-007}{
\itemize{ 

\item \code{\link{panel.lift}} was moved out of the examples in \code{?lift} and into the
   package along with another function, \code{\link{panel.lift2}}.

\item \code{\link{lift}} now uses \code{\link{panel.lift2}} by default

\item  Added robust regularized linear discriminant analysis from the
   \cpkg{rrlda} package

\item Added \code{evtree} from \cpkg{evtree}

\item A weird bug was fixed that occurred when some models were run with
   sequential parameters that were fixed to single values (thanks to
   Antoine Stevens for finding this issue).

item Another bug was fixed where pre-processing with \code{\link{train}} could fail

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.03-003}{
\itemize{ 

\item  pre-processing in \code{\link{train}} did not occur for the final model fit

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.02-011}{
\itemize{ 

\item A function, \code{\link{lift}}, was added to create lattice
objects for lift plots.

\item Several models were added from the \cpkg{obliqueRF} package:
   'ORFridge' (linear combinations created using L2 regularization),
   'ORFpls' (using partial least squares), 'ORFsvm' (linear support
   vector machines), and 'ORFlog' (using logistic regression). As of
   now, the package only support classification.

\item Added regression models \code{simpls} and
   \code{widekernelpls}. These are new models since both
   \code{\link{train}} and \code{\link[pls]{plsr}} have an argument
   called \code{method}, so the computational algorithm could not be
   passed through using the three dots.

\item Model \code{rpart} was added that uses \code{cp} as the tuning
   parameter. To make the model codes more consistent, \code{rpart}
   and \code{ctree} correspond to the nominal tuning parameters
   (\code{cp} and \code{mincriterion}, respectively) and \code{rpart2}
   and \code{ctree2} are the alternate versions using \code{maxdepth}.

\item The text for \code{ctree}'s tuning parameter was changed to '1 -
P-Value Threshold'

\item The argument \code{controls} was not being properly passed
   through in models \code{ctree} and \code{ctree2}.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 5.01-001}{
\itemize{ 

\item \code{controls} was not being set properly for \code{cforest}
models in \code{\link{train}}

\item The print methods for \code{\link{train}}, \code{\link{rfe}} and
\code{\link{sbf}} did not recognize LOOCV

\item \code{\link{avNNet}} sometimes failed with categorical outcomes with \code{bag = FALSE}

\item A bug in \code{\link{preProcess}} was fixed that was triggered by matrices without
   dimnames (found by Allan Engelhardt)

\item bagged MARS models with factor outcomes now work

\item \code{cforest} was using the argument \code{control} instead of \code{controls}

\item A few bugs for class probabilities were fixed for  \code{slda},  \code{hdda}, 
    \code{glmStepAIC},  \code{nodeHarvest},  \code{avNNet} and  \code{sda}

\item When looping over models and resamples, the \cpkg{foreach}
   package is now being used. Now, when using parallel processing, the
   \cpkg{caret} code stays the same and parallelism is invoked using
   one of the "do" packages (eg. \cpkg{doMC}, \cpkg{doMPI}, etc). This
   affects \code{\link{train}}, \code{\link{rfe}} and
   \code{\link{sbf}}.  Their respective man pages have been revised to
   illustrate this change.

\item The order of the results produced by \code{\link{defaultSummary}} were changed
   so that the ROC AUC is first

\item A few man and C files were updated to eliminate R CMD check warnings 

\item Now that we are using foreach, the verbose option in \code{\link{trainControl}},
   \code{\link{rfeControl}} and \code{\link{sbfControl}} are now defaulted to \code{FALSE}

\item \code{\link{rfe}} now returns the variable ranks in a single data frame (previously
   there were data frames in lists of lists) for each of use. This will
   will break code from previous versions. The built-in RFE functions
   were also modified

\item confusionMatrix methods for \code{\link{rfe}} and \code{\link{sbf}} were added

\item NULL values of 'method' in \code{\link{preProcess}} are no longer allowed

\item a model for ridge regression was added (\code{method = 'ridge'}) based on \code{\link[eslasticnet]{enet}}.


 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.98}{
\itemize{ 

\item  A bug was fixed in a few of the bagging aggregation
   functions (found by Harlan Harris).

\item Fixed a bug spotted by Richard Marchese Robinson in createFolds
   when the outcome was numeric. The issue is that
   \code{\link{createFolds}} is trying to randomize \code{n/4} numeric
   samples to \code{k} folds. With less than 40 samples, it could not
   always do this and would generate less than \code{k} folds in some
   cases. The change will adjust the number of groups based on
   \code{n} and \code{k}.  For small samples sizes, it will not use
   stratification. For larger data sets, it will at most group the
   data into quartiles.

\item A function  \code{\link{confusionMatrix.train}} was added to get an average
   confusion matrices across resampled hold-outs when using the
   \code{\link{train}} function for classification.

\item Added another model,  \code{\link{avNNet}}, that fits several neural networks
   via the \cpkg{nnet} package using different seeds, then averages the
   predictions of the networks. There is an additional bagging
   option.

\item  The default value of the 'var' argument of  \code{\link{bag}} was changed.

\item As requested, most options can be passed from
   \code{\link{train}} to \code{\link{preProcess}}. The
   \code{\link{trainControl}} function was re-factored and several
   options (e.g. \code{k}, \code{thresh}) were combined into a single
   list option called \code{preProcOptions}. The default is consistent
   with the original configuration: \code{preProcOptions = list(thresh
   = 0.95, ICAcomp = 3, k = 5)}

\item nother option was added to \code{\link{preProcess}}. The \code{pcaComp}
   option can be used to set exactly how many components are used
   (as opposed to just a threshold). It defaults to \code{NULL} so that 
   the threshold method is still used by default, but a non-null
   value of \code{pcaComp} over-rides \code{thresh}.

\item  When created within \code{\link{train}}, the call for \code{\link{preProcess}} is now 
   modified to be a text string ("scrubed") because the call could 
   be very large.

\item Removed two deprecated functions: \code{applyProcessing} and
\code{processData}.

\item A new version of the cell segmentation data was saved and the
   original version was moved to the package website (see
   \code{\link{segmentationData}} for location). First, several
   discrete versions of some of the predictors (with the suffix
   \code{"Status"}) were removed. Second, there are several skewed
   predictors with minimum values of zero (that would benefit from
   some transformation, such as the log). A constant value of 1 was
   added to these fields: \code{AvgIntenCh2}, \code{FiberAlign2Ch3},
   \code{FiberAlign2Ch4}, \code{SpotFiberCountCh4} and
   \code{TotalIntenCh2}.


 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.92}{
\itemize{ 

\item Some tweaks were made to \code{\link{plot.train}} in a effort to get the group
key to look less horrid.

\item \code{\link{train}}, \code{\link{rfe}} and \code{\link{sbf}} are
now able to estimate the time that these models take to predict new
samples. Their respective control objects have a new option,
\code{timingSamps}, that indicates how many of the training set samples
should be used for prediction (the default of zero means do not
estimate the prediction time).

\item \code{\link{xyplot.resamples}} was modified. A new argument,
\code{what}, has values: \code{"scatter"} plots the resampled
performance values for two models; \code{"BlandAltman"} plots the
difference between two models by the average (aka a MA plot) for two
models; \code{"tTime"}, \code{"mTime"}, \code{"pTime"} plot the total
model building and tuning; time (\code{"t"}) or the final model
building time (\code{"m"}) or the time to produce predictions
(\code{"p"}) against a confidence interval for the average
performance. 2+ models can be used.

\item Three new model types were added to \code{\link{train}} using
 \code{\link[leaps]{regsubsets}} in the \cpkg{leaps} package:
 \code{"leapForward"}, \code{"leapBackward"} and \code{"leapSeq"}. The
 tuning parameter, \code{nvmax}, is the maximum number of terms in the
 subset.

\item The seed was accidentally set when \code{\link{preProcess}} used ICA (spotted
    by Allan Engelhardt)

\item \code{\link{preProcess}} was always being called (even to do nothing)
    (found by Guozhu Wen)

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.91}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added a few new models associated with the \cpkg{bst} package: bstTree, 
bstLs and bstSm.

\item A model denoted as \code{"M5"} that combines M5P and M5Rules from the 
\cpkg{RWeka} package. This new model uses either of these functions
depending on the tuning parameter \code{"rules"}.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.90}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed a bug with \code{\link{train}} and \code{method = "penalized"}. Thanks to
Fedor for finding it.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.89}{
\itemize{ 

\item A new tuning parameter was added for \code{M5Rules} controlling smoothing.

\item The Laplace correction value for Naive Bayes was also added as a 
tuning parameter.

\item \code{\link{varImp.RandomForest}} was updated to work. It now requires a recent
version of the \cpkg{party} package.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.88}{
\itemize{ 

\item A variable importance method was created for \cpkg{Cubist} models.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.87}{
\itemize{ 

\item Altered the earth/MARS/FDA labels to be more exact.

\item Added cubist models from the \cpkg{Cubist} package.

\item A new option to \code{\link{trainControl}} was added to allow
users to constrain the possible predicted values of the model to the
range seen in the training set or a user-defined range. One-sided
ranges are also allowed.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.85}{
\itemize{ 

\item Two typos fixed in \code{\link{print.rfe}} and
\code{\link{print.sbf}} (thanks to Jan Lammertyn)

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.83}{
\itemize{ 

\item \code{\link{dummyVars}} failed with formulas using \code{"."}
   (\code{all.vars} does not handle this well)

\item \code{tree2} was failing for some classification models

\item When SVM classification models are used with \code{class.weights}, the 
options \code{prob.model} is automatically set to \code{FALSE} (otherwise, it
is always set to \code{TRUE}). A warning is issued that the model will 
not be able to create class probabilities.

\item Also for SVM classification models, there are cases when the
probability model generates negative class probabilities. In
these cases, we assign a probability of zero then coerce the 
probabilities to sum to one.

\item Several typos in the help pages were fixed (thanks to Andrew Ziem).

\item Added a new model, \code{svmRadialCost}, that fits the SVM model
and estimates the \code{sigma} parameter for each resample (to
properly capture the uncertainty).

\item \code{\link{preProcess}} has a new method called \code{"range"} that scales the predictors
to [0, 1] (which is approximate for new samples if the training set 
ranges is narrow in comparison).

\item A check was added to \code{\link{train}} to make sure that, when the user passes 
a data frame to  \code{\link{tuneGrid}}, the names are correct and complete. 

\item \code{\link{print.train}} prints the number of classes and levels for classification
models.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.78}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added a few bagging modules. See ?bag.

\item Added basic timings of the entire call to \code{\link{train}}, \code{\link{rfe}} and \code{\link{sbf}}
as well as the fit time of the final model. These are stored in an element 
called "times". 

\item The data files were updated to use better compression, which added a 
higher R version dependency.

\item \code{\link{plot.train}} was pretty much re-written to more effectively use trellis theme
defaults and to allow arguments (e.g. axis labels, keys, etc) to be passed
in to over-ride the defaults.

\item Bug fix for lda bagging function

\item Bug fix for \code{\link{print.train}} when \code{preProc} is \code{NULL}

\item \code{\link{predict.BoxCoxTrans}} would go all klablooey if there were missing 
    values

\item \code{\link{varImp.rpart}} was failing with some models (thanks to Maria Delgado)

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.77}{
\itemize{ 

\item A new class was added or estimating and applying the Box-Cox 
transformation to data called BoxCoxTrans. This is also included as an
option to transform predictor variables. Although the Box-Tidwell
transformation was invented for this purpose, the Box-Cox transformation
is more straightforward, less prone to numerical issues and just as
effective. This method was also added to \code{\link{preProcess}}.

\item Fixed mis-labelled x axis in \code{\link{plot.train}} when a
transformation is applied for models with three tuning parameters.

\item When plotting a \code{\link{train}} object with \code{method ==
"gbm"} and multiple values of the shrinkage parameter, the ordering of
panels was improved.

\item Fixed bugs for regression prediction using \code{partDSA} and
\code{qrf}.

\item Another bug, reported by Jan Lammertyn, related to
\code{\link{extractPrediciton}} with a single predictor was also
fixed.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.76}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed a bug where linear SVM models were not working for classification

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.75}{
\itemize{ 

\item \code{'gcvEearth'} which is the basic MARS model. The pruning procedure 
    is the nominal one based on GCV; only the degree is tuned by \code{\link{train}}.

\item \code{'qrnn'} for quantile regression neural networks from the \cpkg{qrnn} package. 

\item \code{'Boruta'} for random forests models with feature selection via the
    \cpkg{Boruta} package. 

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.74}{
\itemize{ 

\item Some changes to \code{\link{print.train}}: the call is not automatically
   printed (but can be when \code{\link{print.train}} is explicitly invoked); the
   "Selected" column is also not automatically printed (but can be);
   non-table text now respects \code{options("width")}; only significant
   digits are now printed when tuning parameters are kept at a
   constant value

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.73}{
\itemize{ 

\item Bug fixes to \code{\link{preProcess}} related to complete.cases and a single predictor.

\item For knn models (knn3 and knnreg), added automatic conversion of data frames
to matrices

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.72}{
\itemize{ 

\item A new function for \code{\link{rfe}} with \cpkg{gam} was added.

\item "Down-sampling" was implemented with \code{\link{bag}} so that, for 
classification models, each class has the same number of classes
as the smallest class.

\item Added a new class, \code{\link{dummyVars}}, that creates an entire set of
binary dummy variables (instead of the reduced, full rank set).
The initial code was suggested by Gabor Grothendieck on R-Help.
The predict method is used to create dummy variables for any
data set.

\item Added \code{\link{R2}} and \code{\link{RMSE}} functions for evaluating regression models

\item \code{\link{varImp.gam}} failed to recognize objects from \cpkg{mgcv}

\item a small fix to test a logical vector \code{\link{filterVarImp}}

\item When \code{\link{diff.resamples}} calculated the number of comparisons,
   the \code{"models"} argument was ignored.

\item \code{\link{predict.bag}} was ignoring \code{type = "prob"}

\item Minor updates to conform to R 2.13.0

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.70}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added a warning to \code{\link{train}} when class levels are not
valid R variable names.

\item Fixed a bug in the variable importance function for
\code{multinom} objects.

\item Added p-value adjustments to
\code{\link{summary.diff.resamples}}. Confidence intervals in
\code{\link{dotplot.diff.resamples}} are adjusted accordingly if the
Bonferroni is used.

\item For \code{\link{dotplot.resamples}}, no point was plotted when
the upper and/or lower interval values were NaN. Now, the point is
plotted but without the interval bars.

\item Updated \code{\link{print.rfe}} to correctly describe new
resampling methods.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.69}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed a bug in \code{\link{predict.rfe}} where an error was
thrown even though the required predictors were in \code{newdata}.

\item Changed \code{\link{preProcess}} so that centering and scaling are both automatic
when PCA or ICA are requested.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.68}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added two functions, \code{\link{checkResamples}} and
\code{\link{checkConditionalX}} that identify predictor data with
degenerate distributions when conditioned on a factor.

\item Added a high content screening data set (\code{\link{segmentedData}}) from Hill et 
al. Impact of image segmentation on high-content screening data quality 
for SK-BR-3 cells. BMC bioinformatics (2007) vol. 8 (1) pp. 340.

\item Fixed bugs in how \code{\link{sbf}} objects were printed (when using repeated 
CV) and classification models with \cpkg{earth} and \code{classProbs = TRUE}. 


 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.67}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{\link{predict.rfe}}

\item Added imputation using bagged regression trees to 
\code{\link{preProcess}}.

\item Fixed bug in \code{\link{varImp.rfe}} that caused incorrect
results (thanks to Lawrence Mosley for the find).

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.65}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed a bug where \code{\link{train}} would not allow knn imputation.

\item \code{\link{filterVarImp}} and \code{roc} now check for missing values and
use complete data for each predictor (instead of case-
wise deletion across all predictors).

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.64}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed bug introduced in the last version with
\code{createDataPartition(... list = FALSE)}.

\item Fixed a bug predicting class probabilities when using 
\cpkg{earth}/glm models

\item Fixed a bug that occurred when \code{\link{train}} was used with
\code{ctree} or \code{tree2} methods.

\item Fixed bugs in \code{\link{rfe}} and \code{\link{sbf}} when running in
parallel; not all the resampling results were saved

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.63}{
\itemize{ 

\item A p-value from McNemar's test was added to \code{\link{confusionMatrix}}.

\item Updated \code{\link{print.train}} so that constant parameters are not
  shown in the table (but a note is written below the table 
  instead). Also, the output was changed slightly to be
  more easily read (I hope)

\item Adapted \code{\link{varImp.gam}} to work with either \cpkg{mgcv} or \cpkg{gam} packages.

\item Expanded the tuning parameters for \code{lvq}.

\item Some of the examples in the Model Building vignette were changed

\item Added bootstrap 632 rule and repeated cross-validation
  to \code{\link{trainControl}}. 

\item A new function, \code{\link{createMultiFolds}}, is 
  used to generate indices for repeated CV.

\item The various resampling functions now have *named* lists
  as output (with prefixes "Fold" for cv and repeated cv 
  and "Resample" otherwise)

\item Pre-processing has been added to \code{\link{train}} with the
  \code{\link{preProcess}} argument. This has been tested when caret
  function are used with \code{\link{rfe}} and \code{\link{sbf}} (via
  \code{\link{caretFuncs}} and \code{\link{caretSBF}}, respectively).

\item When \code{preProcess(method = "spatialSign")}, centering and 
  scaling is done automatically too. Also, a bug was fixed 
  that stopped the transformation from being executed.

\item knn imputation was added to \code{\link{preProcess}}. The \cpkg{RANN} package
  is used to find the neighbors (the knn impute function in
  the impute library was consistently generating segmentation 
  faults, so we wrote our own).

\item Changed the behavior of \code{\link{preProcess}} in situations where
  scaling is requested but there is no variation in the  
  predictor. Previously, the method would fail. Now a 
  warning is issued and the value of the standard 
  deviation is coerced to be one (so that scaling has
  no effect).

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.62}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added\code{gam} from \cpkg{mgcv} (with smoothing splines and feature 
selection) and \code{gam} from \cpkg{gam} (with basic splines and loess) 
smoothers. For these models, a formula is derived
from the data where "near zero variance" predictors
(see \code{\link{nearZerVar}}) are excluded and predictors with
less than 10 distinct values are entered as linear 
(i.e. unsmoothed) terms.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.61}{
\itemize{ 

\item Changed \cpkg{earth} fit for classification models to use the 
\code{glm} argument with a binomial family. 

\item Added \code{\link{varImp.multinom}}, which is based on the absolute
values of the model coefficients

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.60}{
\itemize{ 

\item The feature selection vignette was updated slightly (again).

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.59}{
\itemize{ 

\item Updated \code{\link{rfe}} and \code{\link{sbf}} to include class probabilities 
in performance calculations.

\item Also, the names of the resampling indices were harmonized
across \code{\link{train}}, \code{\link{rfe}} and \code{\link{sbf}}.

\item The feature selection vignette was updated slightly.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.58}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added the ability to include class probabilities in 
performance calculations. See \code{\link{trainControl}} and 
\code{\link{twoClassSummary}}.

\item Updated and restructured the main vignette.
 
 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.57}{
\itemize{ 

\item Internal changes related to how predictions from models are
stored and summarized. With the exception of loo, the model
performance values are calculated by the workers instead of
the main program. This should reduce i/o and lay some
groundwork for upcoming changes.

\item The default grid for \cpkg{relaxo} models were changed based on 
and initial model fit.

\item \cpkg{partDSA} model predictions were modified; there were cases
where the user might request X partitions, but the model
only produced Y < X. In these cases, the partitions for 
missing models were replaced with the largest model 
that was fit.

\item The function \code{\link{modelLookup}} was put in the namespace and 
a man file was added.

\item The names of the resample indices are automatically 
reset, even if the user specified them.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.56}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed a bug generated a few versions ago where \code{\link{varImp}}
for \code{plsda} and \code{fda} objects crashed.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.55}{
\itemize{ 

\item When computing the scale parameter for RBF kernels, the 
option to automatically scale the data was changed to \code{TRUE}

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.54}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{logic.bagging} in \pkg{logicFT} with \code{method  = "logicBag"}

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.53}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed a bug in \code{\link{varImp.train}} related to nearest shrunken 
centroid models.

\item Added logic regression and logic forests

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.51}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added an option to \code{\link{splom.resamples}} so that the variables in the 
scatter plots are models or metrics.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.50}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{\link{dotplot.resamples}} plus acknowledgements to Hothorn et al 
(2005) and Eugster et al (2008)

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.49}{
\itemize{ 

\item Enhanced the \code{tuneGrid} option to allow a function
to be passed in.
 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.48}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added a \code{prcomp} method for the \code{resamples} class

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.47}{
\itemize{ 

\item Extended \code{\link{resamples}} to work with \code{\link{rfe}} and \code{\link{sbf}}
 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.46}{
\itemize{ 

\item Cleaned up some of the man files for the resamples class 
and added \code{\link{parallel.resamples}}.

\item Fixed a bug in \code{\link{diff.resamples}} where \code{...} were
not being passed to the test statistic function.

\item Added more log messages in \code{\link{train}} when running verbose.

\item Added the German credit data set.
 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.45}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added a general framework for bagging models via the
\code{\link{bag}} function. Also, model type \code{"hdda"} from the
\cpkg{HDclassif} package was added.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.44}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \cpkg{neuralnet}, \code{quantregForest} and \code{rda}
(from \cpkg{rda}) to \code{\link{train}}.  Since there is a naming
conflict with \code{rda} from \cpkg{mda}, the \cpkg{rda} model was
given a method value of \code{"scrda"}.  } }

\section{Changes in version 4.43}{
\itemize{ 

\item Tthe resampling estimate of the standard deviation given 
  by \code{\link{train}} since v 4.39 was wrong

\item A new field was added to \code{\link{varImp.mvr}} called
  \code{"estimate"}.  In cases where the mvr model had multiple
  estimates of performance (e.g. training set, CV, etc) the user can
  now select which estimate they want to be used in the importance
  calculation (thanks to Sophie Bréand for finding this) 
} 
}

\section{Changes in version 4.42}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{\link{predict.sbf}} and modified the structure of
the \code{\link{sbf}} helper functions. The \code{"score"} function
only computes the metric used to filter and the filter function does
the actual filtering. This was changed so that FDR corrections or
other operations that use all of the p-values can be computed.

\item Also, the formatting of p-values in \code{\link{print.confusionMatrix}}  
was changed

\item An argument was added to \code{\link{maxDissim}}
so that the variable name is returned instead of the index.

\item Independent component analysis was added to the list of 
pre-processing operations and a new model ("icr") was
added to fit a pcr-like model with the ICA components.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.40}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{hda} and cleaned up the \cpkg{caret} training vignette 

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.39}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added several classes for examining the resampling results. There

functions for visualization. The training vignette has a new
section describing the new features.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.38}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \cpkg{partDSA} and \code{stepAIC} for linear models and
generalized linear models

\section{Changes in version 4.34}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added two new data sets: \code{\link{dhfr}} and \code{\link{cars}}

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.33}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added GAMens (ensembles using gams)

\item Fixed a bug in \code{roc} that, for some data cases, would reverse the "positive"
class and report sensitivity as specificity and vice-versa.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.32}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added a parallel random forest method in \code{\link{train}} using the \cpkg{foreach} package. 

\item Also added penalized logistic regression using the \code{plr} function in the
\cpkg{stepPlr} package.
 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.31}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added a new feature selection function, \code{\link{sbf}} (for selection by filter).

\item Fixed bug in \code{\link{rfe}} that did not affect the results, but did produce
a warning.

\item A new model function, \code{\link{nullModel}}, was added. This model fits either the
mean only model for regression or the majority class model for classification.

\item Also, ldaFuncs had a bug fixed.

\item Minor changes to Rd files

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.30}{
\itemize{ 

\item For whatever reason, there is now a function in the \cpkg{spls} package
by the name of splsda that does the same thing. A few functions
and a man page were changed to ensure backwards compatibility.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.29}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added stepwise variable selection for \code{lda} and \code{qda} using the 
\code{stepclass} function in \cpkg{klaR}

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.28}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added robust linear and quadratic discriminant analysis functions 
from \cpkg{rrcov}.

\item Also added another column to the output of
\code{\link{extractProb}} and \code{\link{extractPrediction}} that
saves the name of the model object so that you can have multiple
models of the same type and tell which predictions came from which
model.

\item Changes were made to \code{plotClassProbs}: new parameters were added
and densityplots can now be produced.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.27}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \cpkg{nodeHarvest}

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.26}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed a bug in \code{\link{caretFunc}} that led to NaN variable rankings, so
that the first k terms were always selected.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.25}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added parallel processing functionality for \code{\link{rfe}}

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.24}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added the ability to use custom metrics with \code{\link{rfe}}

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.22}{
\itemize{ 

\item Many Rd changes to work with updated parser.

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.21}{
\itemize{ 

\item Re-saved data in more compressed format

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.20}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{pcr} as a method

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.19}{
\itemize{ 

\item Weights argument was added to \code{\link{train}} for models that accept weights

\item Also, a bug was fixed for lasso regression (wrong lambda 
specification) and other for prediction in naive Bayes models
with a single predictor.
 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.18}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed bug in new \code{\link{nearZeroVar}} and updated \code{format.earth} so that it
does not automatically print the formula
 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.17}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added a new version of \code{\link{nearZeroVar}} from Allan Engelhardt that is
much faster
 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.16}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed bugs in \code{\link{extractProb}} (for glmnet) and \code{\link{filterVarImp}}.

\item For glmnet, the user can now pass in their own value of family to 
\code{\link{train}} (otherwise \code{\link{train}} will set it depending on the mode of the 
outcome). However, glmnet doesn't have much support for families at
this time, so you can't change links or try other distributions. 
 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.15}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed bug in \code{\link{createFolds}} when the smallest y value is more than 25%
of the data

 }
}

\section{Changes in version 4.14}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed bug in \code{\link{print.train}}

\itemize{ 

\item Added additional error check to \code{\link{confusionMatrix}}

\item Fixed an absurd typo in \code{\link{print.confusionMatrix}}

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 4.11}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added: linear kernels for svm, rvm and Gaussian processes; \code{rlm} from \cpkg{MASS}; a knn regression model, knnreg

\item A set of functions (class "\code{\link{classDist}}") to computes the class 
    centroids and covariance matrix for a training set for 
    determining Mahalanobis distances of samples to each class 
    centroid was added

\item a set of functions (\code{\link{rfe}}) for doing recursive feature selection 
    (aka backwards selection). A new vignette was added for more 
    details
 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 4.10}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{OneR} and \code{PART} from \cpkg{RWeka}

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 4.09}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed error in documentation for \code{confusionMatrix}. The old doc had \code{"Detection Prevalence = A/(A+B)"} and the new one has \code{"Detection Prevalence =(A+B)(A+B+C+D)"}. The underlying code was correct.

\item  Added \code{lars} (\code{fraction} and \code{step} as parameters)

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 4.08}{
\itemize{ 

\item Updated \code{\link{train}} and \code{bagEarth} to allow \code{earth}
for classification models

 } 
}

\itemize{ 

\item Added \cpkg{glmnet} models

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 4.06}{

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 4.05}{
\itemize{ 

\item Updated again for more stringent R CMD check tests in R-devel 2.9

 } 
}



\section{Changes in version 4.04}{
\itemize{ 

\item Updated for more stringent R CMD check tests in R-devel 2.9

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 4.03}{
\itemize{ 

\item Significant internal changes were made to how the models are
fit. Now, the function used to compute the models is passed in as a
parameter (defaulting to \code{lapply}). In this way, users can use
their own parallel processing software without new versions of
\cpkg{caret}. Examples are given in \code{\link{train}}.

\item Also, fixed a bug where the MSE (instead of RMSE) was reported
for random forest OOB resampling

\item There are more examples in \code{\link{train}}.

\item Changes to \code{confusionMatrix}, \code{sensitivity},
\code{specificity} and the predictive value functions: each was made
more generic with default and \code{table} methods;
\code{confusionMatrix} "extractor" functions for matrices and tables
were added; the pos/neg predicted value computations were changed to
incorporate prevalence; prevalence was added as an option to several
functions; detection rate and prevalence statistics were added to
\code{confusionMatrix}; and the examples were expanded in the help
files.

\item This version of caret will break compatibility with
\pkg{caretLSF} and \pkg{caretNWS}. However, these packages will not be
needed now and will be deprecated.

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.51}{
\itemize{ 

\item Updated the man files and manuals.

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.50}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{qda}, \code{mda} and \code{pda}.

 } 
}


\section{Changes in version 3.49}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed bug in \code{resampleHist}. Also added a check in the \code{\link{train}} functions
that error trapped with \code{glm} models and > 2 classes

 } 
}


\section{Changes in version 3.48}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{glm}s. Also, added \code{varImp.bagEarth} to the
namespace.

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.47}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{sda} from the \cpkg{sda} package. There was a naming
conflict between \code{sda::sda} and \code{sparseLDA:::sda}. The
method value for \code{sparseLDA} was changed from "sda" to
"sparseLDA".

 } 
}


\section{Changes in version 3.46}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{spls} from the \cpkg{spls} package

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.45}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added caching of \cpkg{RWeka} objects to that they can be saved
to the file system and used in other sessions. (changes per Kurt
Hornik on 2008-10-05)

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.44}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{sda} from the \cpkg{sparseLDA} package (not on
CRAN).

\item Also, a bug was fixed where the ellipses were not passed into a
few of the newer models (such as \code{penalized} and \code{ppr})

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.43}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added the penalized model from the \cpkg{penalized} package. In
\cpkg{caret}, it is regression only although the package allows for
classification via glm models. However, it does not allow the user to
pass the classes in (just an indicator matrix). Because of this, it
doesn't really work with the rest of the classification tools in the
package.

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.42}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added a little more formatting to \code{\link{print.train}}

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.41}{
\itemize{ 

\item For \code{gbm}, let the user over-ride the default value of the
\code{distribution} argument (brought us by Peter Tait via RHelp).

 } 
}



\section{Changes in version 3.40}{
\itemize{ 

\item Changed \code{predict.preProcess} so that it doesn't crash if
\code{newdata} does not have all of the variables used to originally
pre-process *unless* PCA processing was requested.

 } 
}



\section{Changes in version 3.39}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed bug in \code{varImp.rpart} when the model had only primary
splits.

\item Minor changes to the Affy normalization code

\item Changed typo in \code{predictors} man page

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.38}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added a new class called \code{predictors} that returns the
names of the predictors that were used in the final model.

\item Also added \code{ppr} from the \cpkg{stats} package.

\item Minor update to the project web page to deal with IE issues


 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.37}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added the ability of \code{\link{train}} to use custom made performance
functions so that the tuning parameters can be chosen on the basis of
things other than RMSE/R-squared and Accuracy/Kappa.

\item A new argument was added to \code{\link{trainControl}} called
    "summaryFunction" that is used to specify the function used to
    compute performance metrics. The default function preserves the
    functionality prior to this new version

\item a new argument to \code{\link{train}} is "maximize" which is a logical
    for whether the performance measure specified in the "metric"
    argument to \code{\link{train}} should be maximized or minimized.

\item The selection function specified in \code{\link{trainControl}} carries
     the maximize argument with it so that customized performance
     metrics can be used.

\item A bug was fixed in \code{confusionMatrix} (thanks to Gabor
Grothendieck)

\item Another bug was fixed related to predictions from least square
SVMs

 } 
}


\section{Changes in version 3.36}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{superpc} from the \cpkg{superpc} package. One note:
the \code{data} argument that is passed to \code{superpc} is saved in
the object that results from \code{superpc.train}. This is used later
in the prediction function.

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.35}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{slda} from \cpkg{ipred}.

 } 
}


\section{Changes in version 3.34}{
\itemize{ 

\item Fixed a few bugs related to the lattice plots from version 3.33.

\item Also added the ripper (aka \code{JRip}) and logistic model trees
from \cpkg{RWeka}

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.33}{
\itemize{ 

\item Added \code{xyplot.train}, \code{densityplot.train},
\code{histogram.train} and \code{stripplot.train}. These are all
functions to plot the resampling points. There is some overlap between
these functions, \code{plot.train} and
\code{resampleHist}. \code{plot.train} gives the average metrics only
while these plot all of the resampled performance
metrics. \code{resampleHist} could plot all of the points, but only
for the final optimal set of predictors.

\item To use these functions, there is a new argument in
\code{\link{trainControl}} called \code{\link{returnResamp}} which should have
values "none", "final" and "all". The default is "final" to be
consistent with previous versions, but "all" should be specified to
use these new functions to their fullest.

 } 
}

\section{Changes in version 3.32}{
\itemize{ 

\item The functions \code{\link{predict.train}} and \code{\link{predict.list}} were
added to use as alternatives to the \code{\link{extractPrediction}} and
\code{\link{extractProbs}} functions.

\item Added C4.5 (aka \code{J48}) and rules-based models (M5 prime) from
\cpkg{RWeka}.

\item Also added \code{logitBoost} from the \cpkg{caTools}
package. This package doesn't have a namespace and \cpkg{RWeka} has a
function with the same name. It was suggested to use the "::" prefix
to differentiate them (but we'll see how this works).
