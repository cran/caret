Version: 5.09-012
Date: 2011-12-10

BUGS:

 - Fixed a bug which occurred when plsda() models were used with class
   probabilities

CHANGES:

 - As of 8/15/11, the glmnet() function was updated to return a
   character vector. Because of this, train() required modification and
   a version requirement was put in the package description file.

-------------------
Version: 5.09-006
Date: 2011-12-6

CHANGES:

 - Shea X made a suggestion and provided code to improve the speed of
   prediction when sequential parameters are used for gbm() models.

 - Andrew Ziem suggested an error check with metric = "ROC" and
   classProbs = FALSE.

BUGS:

 - Andrew Ziem found a bug in how train() obtained earth() class
   probabilities


-------------------
Version: 5.08-011
Date: 2011-11-24

BUGS:

 - Andrew Ziem found another small bug with parallel processing and
   train() (functions in the caret namespace cannot be found).

 - Ben Hoffman found a bug in pickSizeTolerance() that was fixed.

 - Jiaye Yu found (and fixed) a bug in getting predictions back from
   rfe()

-------------------
Version: 5.07-024
Date: 2011-11-13

BUGS: 

 - Using 'saveDetails' in sbfControl() or rfeControl() will save the
   predictions on the hold-out sets (Jiaye Yu wins the prize for
   finding that one).

ADDITIONS:

 - trainControl() now has a logical to save the hold-out predictions.

-------------------
Version: 5.07-005
Date: 2011-11-07

ADDITIONS:

 - type = "prob" was added for avNNet prediction.

 - A warning was added when a model from RWeka is used with train() and
   (it appears that) multicore is being used for parallel
   processing. The session will crash, so don't do that.

BUGS:

 - A bug was fixed where the extrapolation limits were being applied
   in predict.train but not in extractPrediction. Thanks to Antoine
   Stevens for finding this.

 - Modifications were made to some of the workflow code to expose
   internal functions. When parallel processing was used with doMPI or
   doSMP, foreach did not find some caret internals (but doMC did).


-------------------
Version: 5.07-001
Date: 2011-10-21

CHANGES:

 - changed calls to predict.mvr since the pls package now has a
   namespace.

-------------------
Version: 5.06-002
Date: 2011-10-13

CHANGES:

 - a beta version of custom models with train() is included. The
   "caretTrain" vignette was updated with a new section that defines
   how to make custom models.

-------------------
Version: 5.05-004
Date: 2011-10-11

CHANGES:

 - laying some of the groundwork for custom models
 - updates to get away from deprecated (mean and sd on data frames)

BUGS:

 - The pre-processing in train() bug of the last version was not
   entirely squashed. Now it is.

-------------------
Version: 5.04-007
Date: 2011-09-26

CHANGES:

 - panel.lift() was moved out of the examples in ?lift and into the
   package along with another function, panel.lift2.
 - lift() now uses panel.lift2 by default

ADDITIONS:

 - Added robust regularized linear discriminant analysis from the
   rrlda package
 - Added evtree:::evtree

BUGS:

 - A weird bug was fixed that occurred when some models were run with
   sequential parameters that were fixed to single values (thanks to
   Antoine Stevens for finding this issue).
 - Another bug was fixed where pre-processing with train() could fail

-------------------
Version: 5.03-003
Date: 2011-09-23

BUGS:

 - pre-processing in train() did not occur for the final model fit =[

-------------------
Version: 5.02-011
Date: 2011-09-19

ADDITIONS:

 - A function, lift(), was added to create lattice objects for lift plots.
 - Several models were added from the obliqueRF package: 'ORFridge' (linear 
   combinations created using L2 regularization), 'ORFpls' (using partial 
   least squares),  'ORFsvm' (linear support vector machines), and  'ORFlog'
   (using logistic regression). As of now, the package only support 
   classification.

CHANGES:

 - Added regression models 'simpls' and 'widekernelpls'. These are new models
   since both train() and plsr() have an argument called 'method', so the
   computational algorithm could not be passed through using the three dots.
 - Model 'rpart' was added that uses cp as the tuning parameter. To make the 
   model codes more consistent, 'rpart' and 'ctree' correspond to the nominal
   tuning parameters (cp and mincriterion, respectively) and 'rpart2' and 
   'ctree2' are the alternate versions using 'maxdepth'. 
 - The text for 'ctree's tuning parameter was changed to '1 - P-Value Threshold'

BUGS:

 - The argument 'controls' was not being properly passed through in models
   'ctree' and 'ctree2'.

-------------------
Version: 5.01-001
Date: 2011-08-02

BUGS:

 - 'controls' was not being set properly for cforest() models in train()
 - The print methods for train(), rfe() and sbf() did not recognize LOOCV
 - avNNet sometimes failed with categorical outcomes with bag = FALSE
 - A bug in preProcess was fixed that was triggered by matrices without
   dimnames (found by Allan Engelhardt)
 - bagged MARS models with factor outcomes now work
 - cforest was using the argument 'control' instead of 'controls'
 - a few bugs for class probabilities were fixed for 'slda', 'hdda', 
   'glmStepAIC', 'nodeHarvest', 'avNNet' and 'sda'

CHANGES:

 - When looping over models and resamples, the foreach package is
   now being used. Now, when using parallel processing, the caret code
   stays the same and parallelism is invoked using one of the "do" 
   packages (eg. doMC, doMPI, etc). This affects train(), rfe() and sbf().
   Their respective man pages have been revised to illustrate this change.
 - The order of the results produced by defaultSummary() were changed
   so that the ROC AUC is first
 - A few man and C files were updated to eliminate R CMD check warnings 
 - Now that we are using foreach, the verbose option in trainControl(),
   rfeControl() and sbfControl() are now defaulted to FALSE
 - rfe() now returns the variable ranks in a single data frame (previously
   there were data frames in lists of lists) for each of use. This will
   will break code from previous versions. The built-in RFE functions
   were also modified
 - confusionMatrix methods for rfe() and sbf() were added
 - NULL values of 'method' in preProcess are no longer allowed
 - a model for ridge regression was added (method = 'ridge') based on 
   enet()

-------------------
Version: 4.98
Date: 2011-07-25

BUGS:

 - Also, a bug was fixed in a few of the bagging aggregation
   functions (found by Harlan Harris).

 - Fixed a bug spotted by Richard Marchese Robinson in createFolds 
   when the outcome was numeric. 

   The issue is that createFolds is trying to randomize n/4 numeric
   samples to k folds. With < 40 samples, it could not always do 
   this and would generate less than k folds in some cases.

   The change will adjust the number of groups based on n and k.
   For small samples sizes, it will not use stratification. For 
   larger data sets, it will at most group the data into 4
   quartiles.

ADDITIONS:

 - A function confusionMatrix.train() was added to get an average
   confusion matrices across resampled hold-outs when using the
   train() function for classification.

 - Added another model, "avNNet", that fits several neural networks
   via the nnet package using different seeds, then averages the
   predictions of the networks. There is an additional bagging
   option.


CHANGES:

 - The default value of the 'var' argument of bag() was changed.

 - As requested, most options can be passed from train() to 
   preProcess(). The trainControl() function was re-factored and
   several options (e.g. 'k', 'thresh') were combined into a 
   single list option called 'preProcOptions'. The default is
   consistent with the original configuration:

     preProcOptions = list(thresh = 0.95, ICAcomp = 3, k = 5)

   Also, another option was added to preProcess(). The 'pcaComp'
   option can be used to set exactly how many components are used
   (as opposed to just a threshold). It defaults to NULL so that 
   the threshold method is still used by default, but a non-null
   value of 'pcaComp' over-rides 'thresh'.

 - When created within train(), the call for preProcess() is now 
   modified to be a text string ("scrubed") because the call could 
   be very large.

 - Removed two deprecated functions: applyProcessing and processData.

 - A new version of the cell segmentation data was saved and the
   original version was moved to the package website (see 
   ?segmentationData for location).

   First, several discrete versions of some of the predictors (with 
   the suffix "Status") were removed. Second, there are several skewed 
   predictors with minimum values of zero (that would benefit from 
   some transformation, such as the log). A constant value of 1 was
   added to these fields: AvgIntenCh2,  FiberAlign2Ch3,
   FiberAlign2Ch4,  SpotFiberCountCh4 and TotalIntenCh2.


-------------------
Version: 4.92
Date: 2011-07-05

Some tweaks were made to plot.train in a effort to get the group
key to look less horrid.

train(), rfe() and sbf() are now able to estimate the time that
these models take to predict new samples. Their respective
control objects have a new option, timingSamps, that indicates
how many of the training set samples should be used for prediction
(the default of zero means do not estimate the prediction time).

xyplot.resamples was modified. A new argument, "what", has values:

 - "scatter" plots the resampled performance values for two models
 - "BlandAltman" plots the difference between two models by the 
   average (aka a MA plot) for two models
 - "tTime", "mTime", "pTime" plot the total model building/tuning
   time ("t") or the final model building time ("m") or the 
   time to produce predictions ("p") against a confidence interval
   for the average performance. 2+ models can be used.

Three new model types were added to train() using leaps:::regsubsets:
"leapForward", "leapBackward" and "leapSeq". The tuning parameter, 
nvmax, is the maximum number of terms in the subset.

Two bug fixes:
  - the seed was accidentally set when preProcess used ICA (spotted
    by Allan Engelhardt)
  - preProcess was always being called (even to do nothing)
    (found by Guozhu Wen)

-------------------
Version: 4.91
Date: 2011-06-09

Added a few new models associated with the bst package: bstTree, 
bstLs and bstSm.

A model denoted as "M5" that combines M5P and M5Rules from the 
RWeka package. This new model cuses either of these functions
depending on the tuning parameter "rules".

-------------------
Version: 4.90
Date: 2011-06-01

Fixed a bug with train() and method = "penalized". Thanks to
Fedor for finding it.

-------------------
Version: 4.89
Date: 2011-05-26

A new tuning parameter was added for M5Rules controlling smoothing.

The Laplace correction value for Naive Bayes was also added as a 
tuning parameter.

varImp.RandomForest was updated to work =] It now requires a recent
version of the party package.

-------------------
Version: 4.88
Date: 2011-04-28

A variable importance method was created for Cubist models.

-------------------
Version: 4.87
Date: 2011-04-27

Altered the earth/MARS/FDA labels to be more exact.

Added cubist models from the Cubist package.

A new option to trainControl was added to allow users to constrain
the possible predicted values of the model to the range seen in the
training set or a user-defined range. One-sided ranges are also 
allowed.

-------------------
Version: 4.85
Date: 2011-04-01

Two typos fixed in print.rfe and print.sbf (thanks to Jan Lammertyn)

-------------------
Version: 4.83
Date: 2011-03-31

Bug fixes:
 - dummyVars failed with formulas using "." (all.vars does not handle 
   this well)
 - ctree2 was failing for some classification models

When SVM classification models are used with class.weights, the 
options prob.model is automatically set to FALSE (otherwise, it
is always set to TRUE). A warning is issued that the model will 
not be able to create class probabilities.

Also or SVM classification models, there are cases when the
probability model generates negative class probabilities. In
these cases, we assign a probability of zero then coerce the 
probabilities to sum to one.

Several typos in the help pages were fixed (thanks to Andrew Ziem).

Added a new model, svmRadialCost, that fits the SVM model and estimates
the sigma parameter for each resample (to properly capture the 
uncertainty).

preProcess() has a new method called "range" that scales the predictors
to [0, 1] (which is approximate for new samples if the training set 
ranges is narrow in comparison).

A check was added to train() to make sure that, when the user passes 
a data frame to tuneGrid, the names are correct and complete. 

print.train prints the number of classes and levels for classification
models.

-------------------
Version: 4.78
Date: 2011-02-08

Added a few bagging modules. See ?bag.

Added basic timings of the entire call to train(), rfe() and sbf()
as well as the fit time of the final model. These are stored in an element 
called "times". 

The data files were updated to use better compression, which added a 
higher R version dependency.

plot.train was pretty much re-written to more effectively use trellis theme
defaults and to allow arguments (e.g. axis labels, keys, etc) to be passed
in to over-ride the defaults.

Fixed bugs for:

  - lda bagging function
  - print.train when preProc is NULL
  - predict.BoxCoxTrans would go all klablooey if there were missing 
    values
  - varImp.rpart was failing with some models (thanks to Maria Delgado)

-------------------
Version: 4.77
Date: 2011-01-21

A new class was added or estimating and *applying* the Box-Cox 
transformation to data called BoxCoxTrans. This is also included as an
option to transform *predictor* variables. Although the Box-Tidwell
transformation was invented for this purpose, the Box-Cox transformation
is more straightforward, less prone to numerical issues and just as
effective. This method was also added to preProcess.

Fixed mis-labelled x axis in plot.train when a transformation is applied
for models with three tuning parameters.

When plotting a train object with method == "gbm" and multiple values
of the shrinkage parameter, the ordering of panels was improved.

Fixed bugs for regression prediction using partDSA and qrf. Another bug,
reported by Jan Lammertyn, related to extractPrediciton with a single
predictor was also fixed. 

-------------------
Version: 4.76
Date: 2011-01-07

Fixed a bug where linear SVM models were not working for classification

-------------------
Version: 4.75
Date: 2010-12-27

New model types:

  - 'gcvEearth' which is the basic MARS model. The pruning procedure 
    is the nominal one based on GCV; only the degree is tuned by train().
  - 'qrnn' for quantile regression neural networks from the qrnn package. 
  - 'Boruta' for random forests models with feature selection via the
    Boruta package. 

-------------------
Version: 4.74
Date: 2010-12-27

Some changes to print.train:
 - the call is not automatically printed (but can be when print.train is
   explicitly invoked)
 - the "Selected" column is also not automatically printed (but can be)
 - non-table text now respects options("width")
 - only significant digits are now printed when tuning parameters are 
   kept at a constant value

-------------------
Version: 4.73
Date: 2010-12-21

Bug fixes to preProcess related to complete.cases and a single predictor.

For knn models (knn3 and knnreg), added automatic conversion of data frames
to matrices

-------------------
Version: 4.72
Date: 2010-12-17

A new function for RFE with gam:::gam was added.

"Down-sampling" was implemented with bag() so that, for 
classification models, each class has the same number of classes
as the smallest class.

Added a new class, dummyVars, that creates an entire set of
binary dummy variables (instead of the reduced, full rank set).
The initial code was suggested by Gabor Grothendieck on R-Help.
The predict method is used to create dummy variables for any
data set.

Added R2 and RMSE functions for evaluating regression models

Bug fixes:
 - varImp.gam() failed to recognize objects from mgcv
 - a small fix to test a logical vector filterVarImp()
 - when diff.resamples calculated the number of comparisons,
   the "models" argument was ignored.
 - predict.bag was ignoring type = "prob"
 - minor updates to conform to R 2.13.0

-------------------
Version: 4.70
Date: 2010-11-09

Added a warning to train when class levels are not valid R variable
names.

Fixed a bug in the variable importance function for multinom objects.

Added p-value adjustments to summary.diff.resamples. Confidence intervals
in dotplot.diff.resamples are adjusted accordingly if the Bonferroni is
used.

For dotplot.resamples(), no point was plotted when the upper and/or
lower interval values were NaN. Now, the point is plotted but without
the interval bars.

Updated print.rfe to correctly describe new resampling methods.

-------------------
Version: 4.69
Date: 2010-10-28

Fixed a bug in predict.rfe where an error was thrown even though
the required predictors were in newdata.

Changed preProcess() so that centering and scaling are both automatic
when PCA or ICA are requested.

-------------------
Version: 4.68
Date: 2010-10-21

Added two functions, checkResamples() and checkConditionalX() that
identify predictor data with degenerate distributions when conditioned
on a factor.

Added a high content screening data set (segmentedData) from Hill et 
al. Impact of image segmentation on high-content screening data quality 
for SK-BR-3 cells. BMC bioinformatics (2007) vol. 8 (1) pp. 340.

Fixed bugs in how sbf objects were printed (when using repeated 
CV) and classification models with earth and classProbs = TRUE. 


-------------------
Version: 4.67
Date: 2010-10-13

Added predict.rfe

Added imputation using bagged regression trees to 
preProcess().

Fixed bug in varImp.rfe that caused incorrect results
(thanks to Lawrence Mosley for the find).


-------------------
Version: 4.65
Date: 2010-10-08

Fixed a bug where train() would not allow knn imputation.

filterVarImp() and roc() now check for missing values and
use complete data for each predictor (instead of case-
wise deletion across all predictors).

-------------------
Version: 4.64
Date: 2010-10-06

Fixed bug introduced in the last version with
createDataPartition(... list = FALSE).

Fixed a bug predicting class probabilities when using 
earth/glm models

Fixed a bug that occurred when train() was used with
ctree or ctree2 methods.

Fixed bugs in rfe() and sbf() when running in
parallel; not all the resampling results were saved

-------------------
Version: 4.63
Date: 2010-09-19

Misc:

o A p-value from McNemar's test was added to confusionMatrix.

o Updated print.train so that constant parameters are not
  shown in the table (but a note is written below the table 
  instead). Also, the output was changed slightly to be
  more easily read (I hope)

o Adapted varImp.gam to work with either mgcv or gam packages.

o Expanded the tuning parameters for lvq.

o Some of the examples in the Model Building vignette were changed

Resampling:

o Added bootstrap 632 rule and repeated cross-validation
  to trainControl. A new function, createMultiFolds, is 
  used to generate indices for repeated CV.

o The various resampling functions now have *named* lists
  as output (with prefixes "Fold" for cv and repeated cv 
  and "Resample" otherwise)

Pre-processing:

o Pre-processing has been added to train with the preProcess
  argument. This has been tested when caret function are used
  with rfe() and sbf() (via caretFuncs and caretSBF, 
  respectively).

o When preProcess(method = "spatialSign"), centering and 
  scaling is done automatically too. Also, a bug was fixed 
  that stopped the transformation from being executed.

o knn imputation was added to preProcess(). The RANN package
  is used to find the neighbors (the knn impute function in
  the impute library was consistently generating segmentation 
  faults, so we wrote our own).

o Changed the behavior of preProcess in situations where
  scaling is requested but there is no variation in the  
  predictor. Previously, the method would fail. Now a 
  warning is issued and the value of the standard 
  deviation is coerced to be one (so that scaling has
  no effect).

-------------------
Version: 4.62
Date: 2010-09-08

Added mgcv:::gam (with smoothing splines and feature 
selection) and gam:::gam (with basic splines and loess) 
smoothers. For these models, a formula is derived
from the data where "near zero variance" predictors
(see ?nearZerVar) are excluded and predictors with
less than 10 distinct values are entered as linear 
(i.e. unsmoothed) terms.

-------------------
Version: 4.61
Date: 2010-09-05

Changed earth fit for classification models to use the 
glm argument with a binomial family. 

Added varImp.multinom, which is based on the absolute
values of the model coefficients

-------------------
Version: 4.60
Date: 2010-09-02

The feature selection vignette was updated slightly (again).

-------------------
Version: 4.59
Date: 2010-09-01

Updated rfe() and sbf() to include class probabilities 
in performance calculations.

Also, the names of the resampling indices were harmonized
across train(), rfe() and sbf().

The feature selection vignette was updated slightly.

-------------------
Version: 4.58
Date: 2010-08-28

Added the ability to include class probabilities in 
performance calculations. See ?trainControl and 
?twoClassSummary.

Updated and restructured the main vignette.
 
-------------------
Version: 4.57
Date: 2010-08-25

Internal changes related to how predictions from models are
stored and summarized. With the exception of loo, the model
performance values are calculated by the workers instead of
the main program. This should reduce i/o and lay some
groundwork for upcoming changes.

The default grid for relaxo models were changed based on 
and initial model fit.

partDSA model predictions were modified; there were cases
where the user might request X partitions, but the model
only produced Y < X. In these cases, the partitions for 
missing models were replaced with the largest model 
that was fit.

The function modelLookup() was put in the namespace and 
a man file was added.

The names of the resample indices are automatically 
reset, even if the user specified them.


-------------------
Version: 4.56
Date: 2010-08-19

Fixed a bug generated a few versions ago where varImp 
for plsda and fda objects crashed.


-------------------
Version: 4.55
Date: 2010-08-18

When computing the scale parameter for RBF kernels, the 
option to automatically scale the data was changed to TRUE

-------------------
Version: 4.54
Date: 2010-08-17

Added logic.bagging in logicFT with method  = "logicBag"

-------------------
Version: 4.53
Date: 2010-08-16

Fixed a bug in varImp.train related to nearest shrunken 
centroid models.

Added logic regression and logic forests

-------------------
Version: 4.51
Date: 2010-08-10

Added an option to splom.resamples so that the variables in the 
scatter plots are models or metrics.

-------------------
Version: 4.50
Date: 2010-08-09

Added dotplot.resamples plus acknowledgements to Hothorn et al 
(2005) and Eugster et al (2008)

-------------------
Version: 4.49
Date: 2010-08-08

Enhanced the tuneGrid option to allow a function
to be passed in.

-------------------
Version: 4.48
Date: 2010-08-06

Added a prcomp method for the resamples class

-------------------
Version: 4.47
Date: 2010-08-05

Extended resamples() to work with rfe() and sbf()

-------------------
Version: 4.46
Date: 2010-08-04

Cleaned up some of the man files for the resamples class 
and added parallel.resamples.

Fixed a bug in diff.resamples where ... were not being
passed to the test statistic function.

Added more log messages in train() when running verbose.

Added the German credit data set.

-------------------
Version: 4.45
Date: 2010-07-25

Added a general framework for bagging models via the 
bag() function. Also, model type "hdda" from the HDclassif
package was added.

-------------------
Version: 4.44
Date: 2010-07-19

Added neuralnet, quantregForest and rda:::rda to train(). 
Since there is a naming conflict with mda:::rda, the 
rda:::rda model was given a method value of "scrda".

-------------------
Version: 4.43
Date: 2010-06-30

Bug fix release:

o the resampling estimate of the standard deviation given 
  by train() since v 4.39 was wrong

o a new field was added to varImp.mvr called "estimate".
  In cases where the mvr model had multiple estimates of
  performance (e.g. training set, CV, etc) the user can
  now select which estimate they want to be used in the
  importance calculation (thanks to Sophie Bréand for
  finding this)

-------------------
Version: 4.42
Date: 2010-06-09

Added predict.sbf and modified the structure of the sbf 
helper functions. The "score" function only computes 
the metric used to filter and the filter function does
the actual filtering. This was changed so that FDR 
corrections or other operations that use all of the 
p-values can be computed. 

Also, the formatting of p-values in print.confusionMatrix  
was changed and an argument was added to maxDissim
so that the variable name is returned instead of the index.

Independent component analysis was added to the list of 
pre-processing operations and a new model ("icr") was
added to fit a pcr-like model with the ICA components.

-------------------
Version: 4.40
Date: 2010-05-19

Added hda and cleaned up the caret training vignette 

-------------------
Version: 4.39
Date: 2010-05-15

Added several classes for examining the resampling results. There
are methods for estimating pair-wise differences and lattice
functions for visualization. The training vignette has a new
section describing the new features.

-------------------
Version: 4.38
Date: 2010-05-12

Added partDSA and stepAIC for linear models and generalized
linear models

-------------------
Version: 4.37
Date: 2010-04-18

Fixed a new bug in how resampling results are exported

-------------------
Version: 4.36
Date: 2010-04-17

Added penalized linear models from the foba package

-------------------
Version: 4.35
Date: 2010-04-15

Added rocc classification and fixed a typo.

-------------------
Version: 4.34
Date: 2010-03-17

Added two new data sets: dhfr and cars

-------------------
Version: 4.33
Date: 2010-03-01

Added GAMens (ensembles using gams)

Fixed a bug in roc() that, for some data cases, would reverse the "positive"
class and report sensitivity as specificity and vice-versa.

-------------------
Version: 4.32
Date: 2009-12-24

Added a parallel random forest method in train() using the foreach package. 
Also added penalized logistic regression using the plr() function in the
stepPlr package.

-------------------
Version: 4.31
Date: 2009-12-07

Added a new feature selection function, sbf (for selection by filter).

Fixed bug in rfe that did not affect the results, but did produce
a warning.

A new model function, nullModel, was added. This model fits either the
mean only model for regression or the majority class model for classification.

Also, ldaFuncs had a bug fixed.

Minor changes to Rd files

-------------------
Version: 4.30
Date: 2009-11-09

For whatever reason, there is now a function in the spls package
by the name of splsda that does the same thing. A few functions
and a man page were changed to ensure backwards compatibility.

-------------------
Version: 4.29
Date: 2009-11-06

Added stepwise variable selection for lda and qda using the 
stepclass function in klaR

-------------------
Version: 4.28
Date: 2009-11-05

Added robust linear and quadratic discriminant analysis functions 
from rrcov.

Also added another column to the output of extractPRob and 
extractPrediction that saves the name of the model object so
that you can have multiple models of the same type and tell
which predictions came from which model.

Changes were made to plotClassProbs: new parameters were added
and densityplots can now be produced.

-------------------
Version: 4.27
Date: 2009-11-01

Added nodeHarvest


-------------------
Version: 4.26
Date: 2009-10-26

Fixed a bug in caretFunc() that led to NaN variable rankings, so that
the first k terms were always selected.


-------------------
Version: 4.25
Date: 2009-10-03

Added parallel processing functionality for rfe()


-------------------
Version: 4.24
Date: 2009-09-29

Added the ability to use custom metrics with rfe()


-------------------
Version: 4.22
Date: 2009-09-23

Many Rd changes to work with updated parser.


-------------------
Version: 4.21
Date: 2009-09-18

Re-saved data in more compressed format

-------------------
Version: 4.20
Date: 2009-07-19

Added pcr as a method


-------------------
Version: 4.19
Date: 2009-06-30

Weights argument was added to train for models that accept weights

Also, a bug was fixed for lasso regression (wrong lambda 
specification) and other for prediction in naive Bayes models
with a single predictor.


-------------------
Version: 4.18
Date: 2009-06-17

Fixed bug in new nearZeroVar and updated format.earth so that it
does not automatically print the formula


-------------------
Version: 4.17
Date: 2009-06-04

Added a new version of nearZeroVar from Allan Engelhardt that is
much faster


-------------------
Version: 4.16
Date: 2009-05-21

Fixed bugs in extractProb (for glmnet) and filterVarImp.

For glmnet, the user can now pass in their own value of family to 
train (otherwise train will set it depending on the mode of the 
outcome). However, glmnet doesn't have much support for families at
this time, so you can't change links or try other distributions. 

-------------------
Version: 4.15
Date: 2009-05-13

Fixed bug in createFolds when the smallest y value is more than 25%
of the data

-------------------
Version: 4.14
Date: 2009-05-13

Fixed bug in print.train

-------------------
Version: 4.13
Date: 2009-05-12

Added vbmp from vbmp package

-------------------
Version: 4.12
Date: 2009-05-07

Added additional error check to confusionMatrix and fixed an
absurd typo in print.confusionMatrix

-------------------
Version: 4.11
Date: 2009-04-25

Added 

  - linear kernels for svm, rvm and Gaussian processes
  - rlm from MASS
  - a knn regression model, knnreg
  - a set of functions (class "classDist") to computes the class 
    centroids and covariance matrix for a training set for 
    determining Mahalanobis distances of samples to each class 
    centroid 
  - a set of functions (rfe) for doing recursive feature selection 
    (aka backwards selection). A new vignette was added for more 
    details

-------------------
Version: 4.10
Date: 2009-03-20

Added OneR and PART from RWeka

-------------------
Version: 4.09
Date: 2009-03-20

- Fixed error in documentation for confusionMatrix:

  old:     Detection Prevalence = \frac{A}{A+B}
  correct: Detection Prevalence = \frac{A+B}{A+B+C+D}

  The underlying code was correct.

- Added lars (fraction and step as parameters)

-------------------
Version: 4.08
Date: 2009-02-18

Updated train and bagEarth to allow earth for classification models

-------------------
Version: 4.07
Date: 2009-01-25

Added glmnet models

-------------------
Version: 4.06
Date: 2009-01-24

Added code for sparse PLS classification.

Fix a bug in prediction for caTools::LogitBoost

-------------------
Version: 4.05
Date: 2009-01-23

Updated again for more stringent R CMD check tests in R-devel 2.9

-------------------
Version: 4.04
Date: 2009-01-22

Updated for more stringent R CMD check tests in R-devel 2.9

-------------------
Version: 4.03
Date: 2009-01-20

Significant internal changes were made to how the models are fit. Now, the 
function used to compute the models is passed in as a parameter (defaulting to 
lapply). In this way, users can use their own parallel processing software 
without new versions of caret. Examples are given in ?train.

Also, fixed a bug where the MSE (instead of RMSE) was reported for 
random forest OOB resampling

There are more examples in ?train.

Changes to confusionMatrix, sensitivity, specificity and the 
predictive value functions:

  - each was made more generic with default and table methods
  - confusionMatrix "extractor" functions for matrices and tables 
    were added
  - the pos/neg predicted value computations were changed to incorporate 
    prevalence
  - prevalence was added as an option to several functions 
  - detection rate and prevalence statistics were added to confusionMatrix
  - the examples were expanded in the help files

This version of caret will break compatibility with caretLSF and 
caretNWS. However, these packages will not be needed now and will be 
deprecated.

-------------------
Version: 3.51
Date: 2008-12-03

Updated the man files and manuals.

-------------------
Version: 3.50
Date: 2008-12-02

Added qda, mda and pda.

-------------------
Version: 3.49
Date: 2008-11-30

Fixed bug in resampleHist. Also added a check in the train functions
that error trapped with glm models and > 2 classes

-------------------
Version: 3.48
Date: 2008-11-30

Added glms. Also, added varImp.bagEarth to the namespace.

-------------------
Version: 3.47
Date: 2008-11-24

Added sda from the sda package. There was a naming conflict between 
sda::sda and sparseLDA:::sda. The method value for sparseLDA was
changed from "sda" to "sparseLDA".

-------------------
Version: 3.46
Date: 2008-11-11

Added spls from the spls package

-------------------
Version: 3.45
Date: 2008-10-17

Added caching of RWeka objects to that they can be saved to the file system and
used in other sessions. (changes per Kurt Hornik on 2008-10-05)

-------------------
Version: 3.44
Date: 2008-10-15

Added sda from the sparseLDA package (not on CRAN). 

Also, a bug was fixed where the ellipses were not passed into a few of the newer 
models (such as penalized and ppr)

-------------------
Version: 3.43
Date: 2008-10-03

Added the penalized model from the penalized package. In caret, it is regression only
although the package allows for classification via glm models. However, it does not
allow the user to pass the classes in (just an indicator matrix). Because of this, it
doesn't really work with the rest of the classification tools in the package.

-------------------
Version: 3.42
Date: 2008-09-26

Added a little more formatting to print.train

-------------------
Version: 3.41
Date: 2008-09-19

For gbm, let the user over-ride the default value of the distribution argument (brought
us by Peter Tait via RHelp).

-------------------
Version: 3.40
Date: 2008-09-18

Changed predict.preProcess so that it doesn't crash if newdata does not have all of the
variables used to originally pre-process *unless* PCA processing was requested.

-------------------
Version: 3.39
Date: 2008-09-18

Fixed bug in varImp.rpart when the model had only primary splits.

Minor changes to the Affy normalization code

Changed typo in predictors man page

-------------------
Version: 3.38
Date: 2008-09-09

Added a new class called predictors that returns the names of the predictors that were
used in the final model.

Also added ppr from the stats package.

Minor update to the project web page to deal with IE issues

-------------------
Version: 3.37
Date: 2008-09-04

Added the ability of train to use custom made performance functions so that the tuning
parameters can be chosen on the basis of things other than RMSE/R-squared and 
Accuracy/Kappa. Specific changes:

  - a new argument was added to trainControl called "summaryFunction" that is used
    to specify the function used to compute performance metrics. The default function
    preserves the functionality prior to this new version

   - a new argument to train is "maximize" which is a logical for whether the 
    performance measure specified in the "metric" argument to train should be 
    maximized or minimized.

   - the selection function specified in trainControl carries the maximize argument with
     it so that customized performance metrics can be used.

Other changes:

  - a bug was fixed in confusionMatrix (thanks to Gabor Grothendieck)

  - another bug was fixed related to predictions from least square SVMs 

-------------------
Version: 3.36
Date: 2008-08-29

Added superpc from the superpc package. One note: the data argument that is passed
to superpc is saved in the object that results from superpc.train. This is used later in
the prediction function.

-------------------
Version: 3.35
Date: 2008-08-27

Added slda from ipred

-------------------
Version: 3.34
Date: 2008-08-25

Fixed a few bugs related to the lattice plots from version 3.33.

Also added the ripper (aka JRip) and logistic model trees from RWeka

-------------------
Version: 3.33
Date: 2008-08-22

Added xyplot.train, densityplot.train, histogram.train and stripplot.train. These are 
all functions to plot the resampling points. There is some overlap between these
functions, plot.train and resampleHist. plot.train gives the average metrics only while 
these plot all of the resampled performance metrics. resampleHist could plot all of the 
points, but only for the final optimal set of predictors.

To use these functions, there is a new argument in trainControl called returnResamp 
which should have values "none", "final" and "all". The default is "final" to be consistent 
with previous versions, but "all" should be specified to use these new functions to their 
fullest.

-------------------
Version: 3.32
Date: 2008-07-28

The functions "predict.train" and "predict.list" were added to use as alternatives to the
extractPrediction and extractProbs functions. 

Added C4.5 (aka J48) and rules-based models (M5 prime) from RWeka.

Also added logitBoost from the caTools package. This package doesn't have a 
namespace and RWeka has a function with the same name. It was suggested to use the
"::" prefix to differentiate them (but we'll see how this works).
